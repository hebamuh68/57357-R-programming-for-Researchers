# Introduction to R: Part 1

**Author:** Sameh MAGDELDIN, M.V.Sc, 2 Ph.D  
**Date:** November 2024  

## Why Choose R?

R is a powerful programming language widely used among researchers for:
- Statistical computing
- Big data processing
- Creating elegant graphics

### Key Benefits:
1. Completely free and open-source
2. Handles large datasets efficiently
3. Produces high-quality graphics
4. Has a vast community and extensive support
5. Outperforms other statistical software like SPSS, SAS, and Matlab

## Getting Started

### 1. Installing R
Download R from [CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network)](http://cran.r-project.org/):
1. Use default settings during installation.
2. Select 32-bit or 64-bit based on your operating system.
3. Enable additional tasks like creating a desktop icon.

### 2. Installing RStudio
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is an IDE for R that simplifies coding and project management.  
**Note:** Install R first, as RStudio depends on it.

---

## Setting Up RStudio

1. Open RStudio and navigate to `Tools > Global Options > General`.
   - **Optional:** Enable "Restore .RData on exit" to save your workspace automatically.
2. Use `Tab` for auto-completion while typing.

### Creating a New Project:
1. Select `File > New Project`.
2. Choose `New Directory > Empty Project`.
3. Set a name and directory for your project.

---

## Installing Packages

R requires packages for specific tasks:
- Data processing: `dplyr`
- Graphics: `ggplot2`, `lattice`

Install packages using RStudio:
```R
install.packages("package_name")
```
Alternatively, download packages from CRAN and install from a local file.

## Loading and Working with Data

### Example: Loading a CSV File
1. Save your spreadsheet as a `.csv` file (one sheet only).
2. Place the file in your working directory.
3. Use the following code to load the data:
   ```R
   data <- read.csv("test1.csv", header = TRUE)
   ```

### Example: Copy-Pasting Data
```R
copied <- read.table(file = "clipboard", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

### Built-in File Browser
```R
copied <- read.csv(file.choose())
```

---

## Basic Data Operations

### Sample Data
```R
A <- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 6, 42, 2)
B <- c(34, 5, 6, 4, 3, 5, 98, 5, 3)
C <- c(43, 23, 32, 23, 52, 23, 54, 23, 54)
copied <- data.frame(A, B, C)
```

### Summary Statistics
```R
summary(copied)
```

### Boxplot
```R
boxplot(copied)
```

### Check Data Structure
```R
str(copied)
class(copied)
```

---

## R's Help System

Get help on functions:
```R
?summary
help(summary)
??summary
```

---

## Example Workflow

1. Create a `.csv` file with three columns (e.g., A, B, C) and 10 random values.
2. Save it in your working directory.
3. Load and inspect the data:
   ```R
   data <- read.csv("example.csv", header = TRUE)
   summary(data)
   boxplot(data)
   ```

## Congratulations!

You're now ready to start using R for your data analysis and visualization tasks!
