# **dplyr**

1. **Filtering** allows us to focus on specific subgroups, like those in the "advanced" stage of PD who are on medication.
2. **Selecting** specific columns, such as age and tremor severity, helps us focus on the key features for further analysis.
3. **Arranging** helps in organizing the data based on the severity of symptoms (e.g., tremors), which can be useful when assessing the progression of the disease.
4. **Mutating** creates new variables, such as tremor severity percentage, that provide additional insights for better understanding the relationship between symptoms and treatment.
5. **Summarizing** by groups helps compare the characteristics of different stages of PD (e.g., "early", "advanced", or "control" groups), which can be useful for clinical decision-making and monitoring disease progression.
